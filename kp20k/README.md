In order to run the code run the following files:
	1) main_file.py  : This file genrates the best hyperparameters based on the 'dev' set.
	2) Prediction.py : This file generates the final precision and recall for the 'test' set and saves them in a 'csv' file.
	
NOTE: The main_file.py just calls a number of scripts in succession, we can also run each script individually after creating a folder named
	  "for_validation" inside the same working directory.
